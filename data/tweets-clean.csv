942,The Senate needs to vote on $2000 #covid relief for working people BEFORE the new year - I will continue to object to votes on the bad defense bill until we do,1.34442E+18
943,Or maybe youd like to apologize for the pathetic wages you pay your workers as you drive mom and pop stores out of business,1.34436E+18
944,I will not consent to a vote on the bad defense bill - which should stay vetoed - unless the Senate votes on $2k #covid relief for working people,1.34401E+18
945,"Working Americans have borne the brunt of this pandemic. Theyve been hammered, through no fault of their own. They deserve $2000 in #covid relief - a fraction of what the banks &amp; big business got. Lets vote now",1.34392E+18
946,.@realDonaldTrump tonight says Senate leadership has promised votes on bills to increase the #covid relief payments to $2000 for working people AND to terminate #Section230. Lets vote!,1.34337E+18
947,".@realDonaldTrump is right - workers deserve much more than $600, as I have repeatedly said &amp; fought for. And theres obviously plenty of $$ to do it - look at what Congress threw away on corporate giveaways &amp; foreign buyouts. Lets get it done",1.34158E+18
948,"I will vote yes on #covid relief bill for one reason and one reason only: it contains direct assistance to working families. That assistance is not nearly enough, fraction of what it should be. But it is something, &amp; for millions of working Americans, its help desperately needed",1.34123E+18
949,"The negotiators are saying they could only find enough $$ for $600/ person relief checks for working people. But mark my words, there will be hundreds of BILLIONS spent on special interests, banks, and government",1.34106E+18

973,I keep hearing the #COVID19 relief bill should be reserved for emergency relief. In what world are working families struggling to get by and waiting in food lines not an emergency?,1.33635E+18

978,The NDAA should not be hijacked for the Democrats woke leftist agenda,1.33421E+18
979,The NDAA does NOT contain any reform to Section 230 but DOES contain Elizabeth Warrens social engineering amendment to unilaterally rename bases &amp; war memorials w/ no public input or process. I cannot support it,1.33421E+18
980,Any COVID relief bill needs to include direct payments to families and individuals in need,1.33389E+18
981,Take Tony Blinken. Hes backed every endless war since the Iraq invasion. Now he works for #BigTech and helps companies break into #China. He has no sense of what working Americans want or need,1.33125E+18
982,.@joshuawongcf and @chowtingagnes were arrested today in Hong Kong. They and millions of other Hong Kongers want nothing more than the rights promised them by #China under international treaty. I will continue the fight to hold Beijing accountable #StandWithHK,1.33096E+18

993,"Whistleblower says @Twitter and @Google routinely suggest censorship topics - hashtags, individuals, websites, many of them conservative - and @Facebook logs them for follow-up on Tasks. But Zuck REFUSES under oath to turn over list of @Twitter or @Google mentions on Tasks",1.32877E+18

995,Zuckerberg to Graham: We dont design @Facebook to be addictive.This is flatly false. The entire business model is based on addiction,1.32873E+18
996,Ive heard from @Facebook whistleblower who revealed @Facebook and @Google and @Twitter coordinate to censor. Facebook has an internal platform to manage it. Ill be asking Mark Zuckerberg and @jack about this at tomorrows hearing,1.32846E+18

1014,BUT Im sure the Bidens will find a way to make money off it,1.31947E+18
1015,What we learned from tonights #PresidentialDebate2020: Biden is going to end USA energy independence &amp; destroy the remaining blue collar jobs in this country so we can go back to being dependent on foreign oil and embroiled in endless Mideast wars. Great plan,1.31947E+18
1016,About to join @AmericaNewsroom #FoxNews - tune in!,1.31928E+18

1018,Senate Judiciary Committee has just voted subpoenas to @Facebook and @Twitter - all Republicans voting yes. BIG victory that didnt look possible even 24 hrs ago,1.31927E+18
1019,Going to the Senate floor NOW to try to force a vote on #Section230 to stop #BigTech censorship - Republicans must stand up and be counted,1.31901E+18
1020,"Last year, @SenatorTimScott and Republicans tried to pass major legislation that would have expanded body cameras, discouraged chokeholds, increased transparency, and finally made lynching a federal crime.

Democrats filibustered the bill because it wasnt anti-police enough.",1.38425E+18
1021,"Proud to introduce the CAROL Act today, alongside @SenatorSinema, one of @RepAndyBarrs friends. This important legislation is a fitting tribute to a wonderful Kentuckian. It embodies Carols lifetime of service to others. I look forward to its passage.",1.38281E+18
1022,"Democrats keep showing they dont care about norms and institutions, only power. The latest example: a bill to pack the Supreme Court and destroy its legitimacy to guarantee the rulings liberals want.",1.38274E+18
1023,"The Washington Post has given the WH its worst rating, Four Pinocchios, for repeated lies about election law. 
 
Democrats want to create a national controversy over voting regulations. But facts keep getting in their way.",1.38238E+18
1024,"There is a bipartisan appetite for smart infrastructure bills. In fact, all the multi-year highway bills have been bipartisan going back decades.

There isnt an appetite for using the word infrastructure to justify a multi-trillion-dollar slush fund for unrelated bad ideas.",1.3821E+18
1025,Foreign terrorists will not leave the U.S. alone simply because our politicians have grown tired of taking the fight to them. The President needs to explain to the American people how abandoning our partners and retreating in the face of the Taliban will make America safer.,1.38205E+18
1026,"Officer Billy Evans died defending this Capitol, its institutions, and the thousands of people who work here. Today the Senate and the entire country are holding Officer Evans and his family in our thoughts and prayers. His sacrifice will not be forgotten.",1.38199E+18

1028,Praying for the United States Capitol Police officers who were attacked at the Capitol. We are still learning whats taken place. Grateful to all the USCP and first responders who are on the scene.,1.37804E+18
1029,The Administrations non-infrastructure infrastructure bill looks like another Trojan horse for far-left demands. Rolling back Right to Work laws. Imposing the biggest new tax hikes in a generation  killing jobs and slowing wage growth when workers need a fast recovery.,1.37737E+18
1030,"The border crisis is not just seasonal. CBP is tracking the largest surge in apprehensions in 20 years. Unaccompanied children are piling up in close quarters.
 
It turns out when politicians spend a two-year campaign advertising a porous border and amnesty, people listen.",1.37516E+18
1031,Tune in now to @FoxNews: I am joining @DanaPerino and @BillHemmer to discuss the crisis at our southern border and the Democrats' plan for a partisan takeover of Americas election systems.,1.37472E+18
1032,"Senate Democrats just spent the last four years using the legislative filibuster and talking constantly about how important it was.

Their reversals arent about principle. Its just raw power. And their excuses insult the intelligence of the American people.",1.3744E+18
1033,"Secretary Mayorkas testified the border is secure and the border is not open.

So either @fema has been deployed just to admire a situation going smoothly... or the Biden Administration is not being straight with the American people.",1.37372E+18
1034,"The science on getting kids back in school is crystal clear. Every day the Biden Administration does not urge schools to reopen safely right now with simple precautions, the most vulnerable kids pay the price.",1.373E+18
1035,The Administration claims their top priority is to beat this virus and end the pandemic. But their nominee to run @HHSGov is woefully unqualified. California AG Xavier Becerra is a partisan politician with no expertise in healthcare.,1.37258E+18
1036,Tune in now to @FoxNews. I am joining @HARRISFAULKNER to discuss Democrats border crisis and the importance of preserving Senate rules on legislation.,1.37221E+18
1037,Breaking Senate rules to **** the filibuster would not open up an express lane to liberal change. It would not open up an express lane for the Biden presidency to speed into the history books. The Senate would function more like a hundred-car pile-up. Nothing moving.,1.37185E+18
1038,I'm glad @SecBlinken and @SecDef are engaging with key Asian allies Japan and South Korea this week. We need to work together to defend against threats from China and North Korea and stand up for democracy in Burma in the face of military dictatorship.,1.37157E+18
1039,"Why did President Biden tell Americans to wait until July 4th to gather in ways that cities, states, and the CDC approve right now?

Why did he present a million vaccines per day as a personal Mission Accomplished moment when its simply the pace Democrats inherited in January?",1.37157E+18
1040,"On Thursday, President Biden spoke in a heartfelt way about grief and loss. But his vision for the road ahead missed the mark. His proclamations broke with Dr. Fauci and his own CDC and ignored what Americans are already doing now. It was like a speech for an alternate universe.",1.37157E+18
1041,"The Administration is flailing and failing on our southern border. The number of unaccompanied children has tripled in two weeks. 

The White House keeps saying Now is not the time to come. So there will be a good time in the future to break federal law and come illegally?",1.36972E+18
1042,"Ive voted for several of President Bidens nominees. But his choices to lead Interior and the EPA appear eager to restart the lefts war on domestic energy. Kentuckians know that when radical policies are on the table, it means their jobs and pocketbooks are on the menu.",1.36968E+18
1043,"House Democrats attempt to forcibly rewrite 50 states election laws would weaken voter I.D., mass legalize ballot harvesting, and let a partisan FEC poke around in more of citizens' political speech.

No wonder the only thing bipartisan about the bill was the vote against it.",1.36942E+18
1044,"Democrats said theyd exploit COVID to restructure things to fit our vision.

Sure enough: Only 9% of their bill for the entire health fight. Only 1% for vaccines. All this borrowed money for a parade of unrelated policies that even left-wing experts say are badly targeted.",1.36806E+18
1045,"We're already set to come roaring back  not due to this liberal spending spree. Democrats inherited a tide that was already turning.

We could have worked together to do something smart &amp; bipartisan to finish this fight ASAP.

Democrats decided to do something else.",1.36785E+18
1046,"TUNE IN NOW: I'm joining @marthamaccallum to discuss the urgent priorities Senate Republicans are focused on -- reopening schools, helping workers, and getting more Americans vaccinated -- and the liberal wish-list Democrats are pushing instead.",1.3672E+18
1047,"Less than 9% of Democrats' spending plan would go to directly fight COVID-19. Less than 1% to vaccinations. 

This isnt a recipe to safely reopen America. Its what Democrats promised almost a year ago: Taking advantage of the crisis to check off unrelated liberal policies.",1.36679E+18
1048,"Only 1% of the Democrats partisan bill goes to vaccines. Less than 9% to the entire health effort. It backs the Big Labor myth that schools cant reopen safely right now  yet only a small fraction of its K-12 money would go out this year.

Liberal ideology, not families' needs.",1.36651E+18
1049,"Only about 1% of the Democrats partisan plan goes to vaccines. Only about 5% of its K-12 funding would even go out this fiscal year. 

Democrats are not addressing the urgent needs of a re-opening America. They started with a preconceived liberal wish-list and worked backwards.",1.36464E+18
1050,"Science and data disprove the Democrats' notion that K-12 schools need their new spending plan before they can open safely.

Under their plan, about 95% of the K-12 money would not even go toward the current years budget.

Stop letting Big Labor move the goalposts on our kids.",1.36434E+18
1051,"The facts are clear: In-person schooling is essential for kids and can be safe. France and Spain have been doing it. The U.K. will have kids back in two weeks. A study from our own CDC last month found that schools can operate safely.

Why won't Democrats accept the science?",1.36427E+18
1052,"The partisan bill Democrats are preparing is stuffed with non-COVID-related liberal goals and more band-aid policies as if the country were going to stay shut down another year.

We need 2021 to be different than 2020. Congress should focus on smart policies to help that happen.",1.36399E+18
1053,Families across Kentucky are still recovering from a week of punishing weather. I am grateful to everyone who pitched in and helped their neighbors stay safe. My team and I are focused and ready to help in the recovery.,1.36396E+18
1054,Rush Limbaugh was a generational media trailblazer. He gave a voice to millions of conservative Americans whom the mainstream media had not even tried to represent. His impact is impossible to overstate. May he rest in peace.,1.36211E+18
1055,"For the three and a half decades that my friend Richard Shelby has served in the Senate, the people of Alabama have had a true heavyweight champion in their corner. Im glad our friend still has two more years to continue his important and effective work here in the Capitol.",1.35917E+18
1056,"Democrats' so-called relief bill includes Sen. Sanderss minimum wage proposal that would **** 1.4M American jobs. This after the President killed many thousands of jobs with Keystone XL.

Killing jobs and destroying opportunity  that's their idea of pandemic relief?",1.3589E+18
1057,"Democrats admitted last March: They see the pandemic as an opportunity to ram through ideological change. 

That's why they are now pushing a sprawling $1.9T plan that even liberal economists say is poorly targeted to the urgent needs of our nation.",1.3589E+18
1058,"Pres. Biden's own scientists agree school appears to be quite safe and we should get our kids back.

Congress sent massive sums for K-12 schools in 2020. Hardly any of it has been spent yet.

Federal funding is not the issue. It's Big Labor moving the goalposts on kids &amp; parents.",1.35736E+18
1059,"Science tells us that in-person school can be safe  and is crucial for childrens futures. We cannot keep this essential part of our society on indefinite hiatus.

No more goalpost-moving from Big Labor. Kids have sacrificed enough. States and districts need to get this done.",1.35704E+18
1060,"Science has spoken and the evidence is clear: It is time to get kids back in school. 

Experts say that with basic precautions, risks of transmission are low. And the costs of the online-only approach for kids are very high.",1.35704E+18
1061,First Navalny was poisoned. Now hes been jailed. Peaceful protesters across Russia are being suppressed. Just the latest in Putins long campaign to subvert democracy and the rule of law. The U.S. and our allies must continue strong measures to hold Putin and cronies to account.,1.35675E+18
1062,Ive had good conversations with @POTUS and @SecBlinken about the need for a swift and decisive response from the U.S. and allies following the coup in Burma. Expect the Administration will quickly sanction the junta and defend democracy.,1.35667E+18
1063,Ive voted for several of President Bidens mainstream cabinet nominees. But his choice to run Homeland Security was blasted by the Obama Administrations own Inspector General for running an immigration law favor factory for powerful Democrats. Bad pick with major ethics issues.,1.35665E+18
1064,"The last four years showed U.S. prosperity, domestic energy security, and reducing emissions do not have to conflict.

This Piecemeal Green New Deal through liberal executive orders gets it dead wrong.

There's nothing ""green"" about a tsunami of pink slips for American workers.",1.35527E+18
1065,"Today, I made clear that if Democrats ever attack the key Senate rules, it would drain the consent and comity out of the institution. A scorched-earth Senate would hardly be able to function. It wouldnt be a progressives dream. It would be a nightmare.

I guarantee it.",1.3542E+18
1066,"The failed Paris deal will hurt American families while China and Russia grow emissions.

The Keystone cancellation will **** union jobs and hurt U.S. energy security.

And a proposal to gut immigration enforcement and give blanket amnesty?

Rough ""day one"" for American workers.",1.35236E+18
1067,"Minority rights on legislation are key to the Senate. President Biden spent decades defending them. More than two dozen Senate Democrats backed them just four years ago.

This isn't complicated. Simply reaffirming that Democrats won't break the rules should not be a heavy lift.",1.35232E+18
