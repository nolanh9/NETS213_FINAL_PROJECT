# Mechanical Turk Task Guide

Our Mechanical Turk HIT is to evaluate the political sentiments of tweets so that we can train a machine learning classifier to learn on that data. Your task as a contributor is to determine if a tweet is Liberal, Conservative, or Neither and how extreme tweets are. These observations are of course subjective, so just try your best to evaluate each tweet from your perspective.
